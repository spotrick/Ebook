#Ebook creation tools

Herewith a set of tools I use to create ebooks, from conversion of plain text to HTML, through to building an ePub file.

##Scripts

* etext2html.pl : script for converting plain text into html, identifying headings, quotes, notes, etc. according to parameters.

##Modules

Modules are collected in the Ebook folder.

* Convert.pm : various text-conversion functions, used by etext2html.pl
* caps.pm : functions for converting UPPERCASE words to *bold*, _italic_, or lowercase.
